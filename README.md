Clonorchis sinensis infection alters the methylation and hydroxymethylation of hepatocellular carcinoma

The molecular mechanisms contributing to the poor prognosis of Clonorchis sinensis (Cs)-infected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain
poorly understood, espe-cially when it comes to DNA methylation.Using parallel whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and wholegenome oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxWGBS), we characterized the profiles of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
(5hmC) in Cs-infected HCC tumors and adjacent non-tumor tissues at single-nucleotide resolution. These profiles were com-pared with data
from non-Cs-infected HCC available in the GEO database. Additionally, we investigated the impact of DNA methylation modifications on
differential gene ex-pression and prognosis in Cs-infected HCC by analyzing HCC related data from the TCGA database and RNA-seq data
from previous studies.Results: Here, we reported the methylation and hydroxymethylation landscapes of Cs-infected and Cs-non-infected
HCC patients at single-nucleotide resolution by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and whole-genome oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxWGBS), respectively. 29 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 13 dif-ferentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs)
were found in Cs-infected HCC tumor tissues compared to Cs-non-infected HCC tumor tissues. Following, we identified 28 dif-ferentially
methylated/hydroxymethylated-associated genes (DAGs/DhAGs), two genes (DHDH and KCNQ3) of which were significantly correlated with
the overall survival of HCC.Finally, we also revealed that four Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine sites in the pro-moter of DAGs/DhAGs certainly
affect the survival outcomes of HCC.This study provides the first comprehensive characterization of DNA methylome and hydroxymethylome
landscapes in Cs-infected HCC, shedding light on the impact of on HCC methylation and offering new insights into the role of Cs in HCC progression. Our findings also highlight the key DMRs/DhMRs and DAGs/DhAGs in Cs-infected HCC tumors, which could serve as promising
epigenetic biomarkers for pre-dicting the prognosis and therapeutic targets of Cs-associated HCC.
